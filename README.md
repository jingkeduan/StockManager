**# StockManager**

**## Application Purpose**
A REST API is built with backend in Java. Postmain is used to mimic the user request sent by frontend. The project is for assessment purposes of the learning outcome from QA DFESW12 Software Development training course. 

The API is one that allows CRUD operations to be made on a database which stores information about supermarket products. Some essential fields in database include quantity, price, category which allows for management of stocks. Some implications from this particular scenario-based API is that it could allow stock management, placing orders at times when stocks are low, and making decisions on discounting products when seasonal stocks are high. 

**## Journey of Building APP**
Five days were allocated for project. Initial expectation was to finish a minimum viable product (MVP) and apply additional features such as DTO, Lombok, custom queries and exceptions. Unfortunately, only a percentage of the time was actually utilised due to external interferences. 

**## Expected Outcome and Implementation of Features**
MVP achieved. Implementation of additional features mentioned in 'Journey of Building API' achieved.

**## Achieved Outcome**
MVP achived with above 90% test coverage. 

**## Possible Future Improvements**
Additional features mentioned in 'Journey of Building API' will be implemented for further learning and project completion. The option of building a front end with JS, CSS or HTML may be explored. Code refactoring and adhering to best practices. Writing README files in a professional manner.
